# SREC QUESTIFY - Automatic Question Paper Generator

SREC QUESTIFY is a web-based application designed to generate question papers automatically from a database of questions. It utilizes a question bank stored in MySQL and dynamically creates random question papers each time a user interacts with the system. The project is developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP, and MySQL, and it runs on XAMPP or any similar local server environment.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The application features a clean and responsive UI developed with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
- **Customizable Question Bank:** Administrators can easily manage and update the question bank.
- **PHP Backend:** The applicationâ€™s logic is powered by PHP, ensuring dynamic data fetching and processing from the MySQL database.
- **Secure Access:** Includes basic authentication and security checks for database operations.

## Prerequisites
- XAMPP (or any local server environment like MAMP or WAMP)
- Web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.)

### Technologies Used
- **HTML5:** For structuring the web pages.
